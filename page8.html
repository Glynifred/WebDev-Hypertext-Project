            you quickly hurry into the room Up ahead!
            <br>finally having caught your breath you look around the room.
            <br>But the sunlight has vanished, and you notice you’re in an empty room with just skeletons!
            <br>you realise you’ll be trapped here till you starve to death.
            <br>maybe being crushed would have been the better way to go?
