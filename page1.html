            As you travel to the right you enter a plain looking room with the entrance shutting behind you.
            <br>you investigate your next options.
            <br>Up ahead you can make out a room with statues and well-crafted armour and tools lying around.
            <br>To the Right a completely empty room however the sunlight seems to be brighter from there.
            <br>Which will it be?
